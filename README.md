# Project ATOMON

Project ATOMON is a Unity-based roguelike card game where players build and battle monsters in a procedurally-generated world. The game features an intuitive card-building system that allows players to create unique and powerful creatures, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. With permadeath and randomized levels, each playthrough of Project ATOMON offers a fresh challenge and a chance to experiment with new monster builds.
